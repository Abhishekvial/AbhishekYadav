üõ°Ô∏è Zero-Day Risk Analyzer
Project Overview:
The Zero-Day Risk Analyzer is a frontend-only cybersecurity tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to input vulnerability descriptions (like those from CVE databases) and instantly receive a simulated risk level (Low, Medium, or High) based on detected keywords. It serves as a lightweight educational and triage tool, simulating how more advanced AI-driven systems might analyze vulnerabilities.

Problem Statement:
Zero-day vulnerabilities pose severe threats to systems, but early detection and triage remain challenging‚Äîespecially without access to expensive or complex tools.

Solution Highlights:
Fully browser-based ‚Äî no backend required

Real-time risk prediction using keyword logic

Clean, professional UI with dark-themed design

Modular design ‚Äî ready for future AI/ML integration (e.g., Graph Neural Networks)

Tech Stack:
HTML5 & CSS3 ‚Äì Structure & Styling

JavaScript (Vanilla) ‚Äì Keyword analysis & logic

(Optional Future) Python + FastAPI + GNNs for backend intelligence

Industry Relevance:
Fits into cybersecurity education, startup tools, and intern training programs

Reflects trends in AI-based vulnerability detection and lightweight client-side analysis

Key Learnings:
Gained hands-on experience in web development & security analysis

Learned how to simulate risk logic from real-world CVE data

Understood how to bridge frontend tools with AI-powered backend potential

Future Scope:
Integrate Graph Neural Network (GNN) backend for deeper code-level analysis

Add API connection to CVE/NVD databases for real-time vulnerability input

Build a CLI or cloud-based version for professional use
