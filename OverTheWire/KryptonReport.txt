KRYPTON: Level 0 --> Level 1 Walkthrough Report
Step-by-step solution:
1. Identifying the encoding:
   - The string had an `=` at the end and looked like a typical Base64 encoded string.
   - Used the following command to decode it:
     echo S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ= | base64 -d
   - The output was:
     KRYPTONISGREAT
2. Logged into the given krypton server:
  - Used the SSH command to connect to the Krypton 1 level:
     ssh -p 2231 krypton1@krypton.labs.overthewire.org
  - Entered the password obtained from Level 0: `KRYPTONISGREAT`
Tools Used:
  - Linux Terminal
Logic:
  - Recognized the encoded format as Base64.
  - Used standard Unix tools (`echo`, `base64`) to decode the password.
  - Used ('ssh') to Login.

KRYPTON: Level 6 ? Level 7 Walkthrough Report
Step-by-Step Commands, Tools, and Logic
1. SSH into Krypton Level 6
Explanation:
Used `ssh` with custom port 2231 to access Krypton Level 6 on OverTheWire. Credentials come from the previous level.
2. Navigating to Krypton Directory
Commands:
cd /krypton/
cd krypton6

Explanation:
Moved into the directory containing encryption tools and the key file.
3. Listing Files in the Directory
Explanation:
Listed files to verify presence of encrypt6 and keyfile.dat.
4. Creating a Temporary Working Directory
Explanation:
Created and navigated to a temp directory to avoid modifying original files.
5. Linking Key File
Explanation:
Created a symbolic link to the keyfile in the working directory.
6. Changing Directory Permissions
Explanation:
Granted full permissions to the directory to prevent permission issues.
7. Creating Plaintext File
Explanation:
Created a plaintext file to test how the encryption works.
8. Encrypting the File
Explanation:
Used encrypt6 to encrypt tale.txt using keyfile.dat; output saved as ciphertale.
9. Viewing Binary Representation
Explanation:
Used xxd to compare the binary versions of plaintext and ciphertext.
10. Creating a File with Repeating Characters
Explanation:
Created a file containing only 'A's to reverse engineer character mapping
11. Viewing Encrypted Output (Optional / Needs correction)
Note:
File name may be incorrect unless a.txt was encrypted and saved as ciphera.txt.

12. Decoding the Final Message
Explanation:
Used a Python script to decode the encrypted message using character substitution logic.
Logic Behind the Solution
- The level is based on a substitution cipher using a keyfile (keyfile.dat).
- By encrypting known input (e.g. a string of 'A's), the cipher key can be reverse engineered.
- Once the substitution mapping is discovered, encrypted messages like "EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN" can be decrypted using a script.
- The decrypted message gives the password to Krypton Level 7.
Tools Used
- ssh – for remote login
- nano – text editor for creating files
- encrypt6 – encryption program provided by OverTheWire
- xxd – to view binary representation of files
- Python 3 – for writing and running decryption script
- chmod, ln, mktemp – Linux utilities for file and permission management
